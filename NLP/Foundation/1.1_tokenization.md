# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics

## 1. Corpus
- **Definition**: A collection of text data used for natural language processing tasks.
- **Purpose**: Serves as the dataset for training, testing, and evaluating NLP models.
- **Types**:
  - **Monolingual Corpus**: Text data in a single language.
  - **Multilingual Corpus**: Text data in multiple languages.
  - **Annotated Corpus**: Text with labeled information (e.g., part-of-speech tags, named entities).

### Example
- **Wikipedia Articles**: A collection of Wikipedia pages about different topics.
- **News Articles**: A dataset of news articles from various sources.

## 2. Documents
- **Definition**: An individual piece of text within a corpus, such as a paragraph, article, or sentence.
- **Role in NLP**: Documents are the units of data that are analyzed or processed.
- **Hierarchy**: A corpus is made up of multiple documents.

### Example
- A single news article in a news corpus.
- A chapter from a book in a literary corpus.

## 3. Vocabulary
- **Definition**: The set of unique words or terms present in a corpus.
- **Importance**: Represents the language used in the corpus and is used for various NLP tasks like text representation.
- **Size Consideration**: The size of the vocabulary can significantly impact the model's complexity.

### Example
- If a corpus contains the documents "Hello world" and "Hello NLP," the vocabulary is `{"Hello", "world", "NLP"}`.

## 4. Words
- **Definition**: The individual units of language that make up sentences or documents.
- **In NLP**: Words are typically analyzed to understand their frequency, meaning, and relationships.
- **Challenges**: Words can have multiple meanings (polysemy) or similar meanings (synonymy).

### Example
- In the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," the words are "The," "cat," "sat," "on," "the," and "mat."

## 5. Tokens
- **Definition**: The smallest units of a text, such as words or subwords, that are used in the analysis.
- **Token vs. Word**: While tokens are often words, they can also be subword units or punctuation marks.
- **Use in NLP**: Tokens are processed to extract meaningful information from text.

### Example
- For the text "Hello, world!", the tokens can be `["Hello", ",", "world", "!"]`.

## 6. Tokenization
- **Definition**: The process of splitting text into tokens.
- **Purpose**: Converts a string of text into individual elements (tokens) for analysis.
- **Types**:
  - **Word Tokenization**: Splits text into words.
  - **Subword Tokenization**: Breaks down words into subword units (e.g., prefixes, suffixes).
  - **Sentence Tokenization**: Divides text into sentences.

### Example
- **Input**: "Natural language processing is fun!"
- **Word Tokenization Output**: `["Natural", "language", "processing", "is", "fun", "!"]`
- **Sentence Tokenization Output**: `["Natural language processing is fun!"]`
