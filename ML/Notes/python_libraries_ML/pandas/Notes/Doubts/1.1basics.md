### Example of Using  `squeeze=True` in `pd.read_csv()`

Let's say,
you have a CSV file named `subs.csv` with the following content:

*subscriber_coun*t  `100 150 200 250 300`

If you load this file using `pd.read_csv()` without `squeeze=True`:

```python
import pandas as pd
# Load the CSV file without squeezing
subs = pd.read_csv('/content/subs.csv')
print(subs)
```
The output will be a `pandas.DataFrame`: 
```yaml
		 subscriber_count //coulmn name
0               100
1               150
2               200
3               250
4               300
```
Now, if you load the same file using `squeeze=True`:

```python
# Load the CSV file with squeezing
subs = pd.read_csv('/content/subs.csv', squeeze=True)
print(subs)
```
The output will be a `pandas.Series`:
```yaml
0    100
1    150
2    200
3    250
4    300
Name: subscriber_count, dtype: int64` 
```
The column name (`subscriber_count`) becomes the name of the Series, and the data is displayed in a one-dimensional format.
### key note:
-   **If the CSV file has multiple columns, `squeeze=True` will not affect the output and a DataFrame will still be returned.**
