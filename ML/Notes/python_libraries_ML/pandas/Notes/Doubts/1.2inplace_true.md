# `inplace=True` in Pandas

The `inplace=True` parameter in pandas functions, such as `sort_index()`, modifies the DataFrame (or Series) directly without creating a new object. 

When `inplace=True` is used, the changes are applied directly to the original DataFrame.
If `inplace=False` (the default), the function returns a new modified **DataFrame**, leaving the original unchanged.
## Example
Suppose, you have a DataFrame named `movies`:
```python
import pandas as pd 
movies = pd.DataFrame({
    'Title': ['Inception', 'Interstellar', 'The Dark Knight', 'Memento'],
    'Year': [2010, 2014, 2008, 2000]
}, index=[2, 4, 1, 3])

print("Original DataFrame:")
print(movies)
```
Output:
```text
              Title  Year
2         Inception  2010
4      Interstellar  2014
1  The Dark Knight  2008
3          Memento  2000
```
Using **sort_index()** Without **inplace=True**
####  Sort by index in descending order without inplace
```python
sorted_movies = movies.sort_index(ascending=False)
print("\nSorted DataFrame (without inplace):")
print(sorted_movies)
print("\nOriginal DataFrame remains unchanged:")
print(movies)
```
Output:
```text
Sorted DataFrame (without inplace):
              Title  Year
4      Interstellar  2014
3          Memento  2000
2         Inception  2010
1  The Dark Knight  2008

Original DataFrame remains unchanged:
              Title  Year
2         Inception  2010
4      Interstellar  2014
1  The Dark Knight  2008
3          Memento  2000
```
In this case, **movies** remains unchanged because **sort_index()** returns a new *DataFrame*.
Using *sort_index()* With **inplace=True**

### Sort by index in descending order with inplace
```python
movies.sort_index(ascending=False, inplace=True)
print("\nDataFrame after sorting (with inplace):")
print(movies)
```
Output:
```text
DataFrame after sorting (with inplace):
              Title  Year
4      Interstellar  2014
3          Memento  2000
2         Inception  2010
1  The Dark Knight  2008
```
Here, the original movies DataFrame is modified in place, and no new DataFrame is created.
## Why Use inplace=True?
- **Memory Efficiency**: Modifying a DataFrame in place can save memory by avoiding the creation of a new object.
- **Convenience**: When you don't need to keep the original DataFrame, inplace=True provides a straightforward way to update it directly.
*However, setting inplace=True can make the code less readable in some cases, as the original object is modified without an explicit assignment.*
